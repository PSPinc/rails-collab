# Collab

Real-time collaborative document editing for Ruby on Rails using ActionCable & Prosemirror based on operational transforms.

> This gem isn't recommended for production use, as the concurrency method for updating documents will strugle under high load.

## How it works

The collab gem exposes an ActionCable channel (`CollabDocumentChannel`) enabling users to start a real-time editing session.
A client may submit one or many steps in a DocumentTransaction to the server, alongside a reference for processing. The gem
attempts to apply the transaction to the document in a background job (`Collab::DocumentTransactionJob`). The job first checks
that the operation applies to the current version of the document, and if so, uses a NodeJS child process running ProseMirror
and JSDom to apply the transaction. If successful, the document is saved and the transaction is broadcasted to clients.

## Requirements

- ActionCable
- NodeJS in your Rails environment, with a `node` executible on the `$PATH`

## Getting started

1. Expose your [ProseMirror schema] as a NodeJS package (use the package registry of your choice or a private Git repository)
   so that it can be accessed either client-side or server-side.

```js
module.exports.plainText = new Schema({
  nodes: {
    text: {},
    doc: { content: "text*" },
  },
});
```

2. Inside your Rails app, install the gem and the npm packages necessary for applying document transforms server-side

```sh
bundle add collab
yarn add @pmcp/authority prosemirror-model prosemirror-transform [your-schema-package]
```

3. Generate the initalizer and migration

```sh
rails g collab:install
```

4. Configure the gem in `config/initializers.rb`. Make sure to set `schema_package` to the name of your schema package.

5. Run `rails db:migrate`

6. Add `HasCollaborativeDocument` to a model

```rb
class BlogPost < ApplicationRecord
  include Collab::HasCollaborativeDocument

  has_collaborative_document :body,
                              schema: "plainText", # this is the name of the export from your schema package
                              blank_document: {"type"=>"doc", "content"=>[{"type"=>"text", "text"=>""}]} # the document used for version 0

end
```

7. Add authorization logic to `app/channels/collab_document_channel.rb`

8. Install the client library

```sh
yarn add prosemirror-collab-plus rails-collab [your-schema-package]
```

9. Add the railsCollab plugin to your ProseMirror view:

```js
import { EditorView } from "prosemirror-view";
import { EditorState } from "prosemirror-state";
import { railsCollab } from "rails-collab";
import { plainText } from "[your-schema-package]";

const cable = ActionCable.createConsumer("ws://cable.example.com");

const originalDocument = blogPost.body; // from ERB, <%= raw json_escape(@blog_post.body.to_json) %>

const target = document.getElementById("editor-view");

const view = new EditorView(target, {
  state: EditorState.create({
    doc: plainText.nodeFromJSON(originalDocument.document),
    plugins: [
      railsCollab({
        cable,
        startingVersion: originalDocument.version,
        params: { document_id: originalDocument.id },
      }),
    ],
  }),
});

// later, to unsubscribe & destroy the editor:
// view.destroy();
```

10. ðŸŽ‰ You're done! Start collaborating.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
